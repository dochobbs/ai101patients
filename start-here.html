        <h2>Something Big Just Happened</h2>

        <p>
          In January 2026, OpenAI launched <strong>ChatGPT Health</strong>—a new feature that lets
          you connect your medical records directly to ChatGPT. With a few clicks, the AI can now
          see your lab results, medications, diagnoses, and health history.
        </p>

        <p>
          This isn't science fiction. It's available now. And the numbers are staggering: ChatGPT
          has over 800 million weekly active users worldwide, and according to OpenAI, approximately
          one in four of them—that's 200 million people each week—submit prompts about healthcare.
          More than 40 million people ask ChatGPT health or insurance questions every single day.
        </p>

            <strong>January 7, 2026:</strong> OpenAI launches ChatGPT Health, allowing users to
            securely connect medical records from over 2.2 million healthcare providers across
            320+ health plans. The integration is powered by b.well's health data platform,
            enabling access to longitudinal patient records spanning multiple electronic
            medical record systems.
          </p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0;" class="citation">
            Source: <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/openai-selects-bwell-to-power-secure-health-data-connectivity-for-ai-driven-health-experiences-in-chatgpt-302655598.html" target="_blank">b.well Press Release, January 2026</a>

        </div>

        <p>
          This is powerful. And a little scary. AI can help you understand your health in ways
          that weren't possible before—summarizing complex medical records, explaining test results
          in plain language, helping you prepare questions for your doctor. But it can also make
          mistakes, misunderstand your situation, or give you advice that sounds confident but
          is completely wrong.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>That's why this guide exists.</strong>
        </p>
      </section>

      <div class="section-divider"></div>

      <section class="long-form-text">
        <h2>Why This Matters Right Now</h2>

        <p>
          You're probably already using AI for health questions—even if you don't realize it.
          When you search on Google, you now see "AI Overviews" at the top of many results.
          When you ask Siri or Alexa a health question, AI is generating the response. When
          you use symptom checker apps, many are powered by AI.
        </p>

        <p>
          But there's a crucial difference between casually asking AI about a headache and
          connecting it to your complete medical history. ChatGPT Health represents a new
          level of AI integration with your personal health data—and that brings both
          opportunities and risks you need to understand.
        </p>

        <h3>The Opportunity</h3>
        <p>
          Imagine having a knowledgeable assistant available 24/7 who has read your entire
          medical history and can:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Explain what your lab results actually mean in plain English</li>
          <li>Help you understand a new diagnosis and what questions to ask your doctor</li>
          <li>Remind you about medication interactions before you take something new</li>
          <li>Prepare a summary of your health concerns before an appointment</li>
          <li>Translate complex medical jargon from your discharge summary</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The Risk</h3>
        <p>
          That same assistant might also:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Sound completely confident while giving you wrong information</li>
          <li>Miss something urgent because it can't actually examine you</li>
          <li>Give generic advice that doesn't apply to your specific situation</li>
          <li>Store your sensitive health data in ways you don't fully understand</li>
          <li>Delay you from seeking real medical care when you need it</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="callout-pearl">
          <div class="callout-title"><i data-lucide="lightbulb"></i> Pearl</div>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
            The goal of AI literacy isn't to make you afraid of these tools—it's to help you
            use them wisely. Understanding both the power and the limitations lets you get
            the benefits while avoiding the pitfalls.

          <summary>Learn More: How did we get here so fast?</summary>
          <div class="learn-more-content">
            <p>
              The rapid advancement of AI in healthcare might seem sudden, but it's been building
              for years. Large language models like ChatGPT represent a breakthrough in AI's ability
              to understand and generate human language—including complex medical terminology.
            </p>
            <p>
              What's new is the integration with personal health records. The infrastructure for
              sharing medical data electronically (through standards like FHIR and partnerships
              with health data platforms) has matured to the point where AI can now access your
              records with your permission.
            </p>
            <p>
              OpenAI reports they worked with over 260 physicians from 60 countries in developing
              ChatGPT Health—but that doesn't mean the technology is perfect. It's an early step
              in a rapidly evolving field.

        <h2>What You'll Learn</h2>

        <p>
          This guide teaches you how to use AI tools for your health—safely and effectively.
          No technical background needed. No medical degree required. Just practical knowledge
          you can apply immediately.
        </p>

        <p>We organize the learning into three main areas:</p>

        <h3>1. Safety First (5 Modules)</h3>
        <p>
          Before you dive into using AI with your health information, you need to understand
          the risks. These foundational modules cover:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>What AI can and can't do</strong> — Setting realistic expectations</li>
          <li><strong>Privacy and your health data</strong> — What happens when you share with AI</li>
          <li><strong>Spotting AI mistakes</strong> — Recognizing when AI is wrong</li>
          <li><strong>When to call your doctor</strong> — Knowing when AI isn't enough</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Practical Skills (6 Modules)</h3>
        <p>
          Once you know the guardrails, you'll learn how to actually use these tools effectively:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>AI tools you should know</strong> — ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and more</li>
          <li><strong>ChatGPT Health deep dive</strong> — Connecting your records step by step</li>
          <li><strong>How to talk to AI</strong> — Getting better answers through better questions</li>
          <li><strong>Understanding AI responses</strong> — Evaluating what you're told</li>
          <li><strong>Preparing for appointments</strong> — Using AI as your preparation assistant</li>
          <li><strong>Researching safely</strong> — Looking up conditions without spiraling</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Going Deeper (3 Optional Modules)</h3>
        <p>
          For those who want to understand more about how these systems work:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>How AI "thinks"</strong> — A plain-language explanation of the technology</li>
          <li><strong>AI bias and health</strong> — Why AI might treat different people differently</li>
          <li><strong>The future of AI in healthcare</strong> — What's coming next</li>
        </ul>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
            AI is a tool, not a doctor. The goal of this guide isn't to replace your healthcare
            team—it's to help you become a better-informed patient who uses AI as one resource
            among many. Think of AI as a research assistant, not a medical advisor.
          </p>

      </section>

      <div class="section-divider"></div>

      <section class="long-form-text">
        <h2>How to Use This Guide</h2>

        <p>
          Each module takes about <strong>15-20 minutes</strong> to read. You can work through
          them in order, or jump to what's most relevant to you. The modules are designed to
          stand alone while building on each other.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Our recommendation:</strong> Start with the "Safety First" modules before
          diving into practical skills. Understanding the risks upfront will help you use
          AI more confidently—and more safely.
        </p>

        <div class="callout-try">
          <div class="callout-title"><i data-lucide="hand"></i> Try This</div>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
            As you read through the modules, try the activities in the "Try This" boxes.
            Learning by doing is more effective than just reading. You don't need any special
            setup—just access to ChatGPT or another AI chatbot.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h3>What You'll See in Each Module</h3>

        <p>Throughout this guide, you'll encounter several types of highlighted boxes:</p>

        <div class="callout-pearl">
          <div class="callout-title"><i data-lucide="lightbulb"></i> Pearl</div>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
            <strong>Pearls</strong> are practical tips and key takeaways you can use right away.
            These are the "if you remember nothing else, remember this" moments.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="callout-news">
          <div class="callout-title"><i data-lucide="newspaper"></i> In the News</div>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
            <strong>In the News</strong> boxes highlight recent developments that affect how you
            should think about AI and health. AI is moving fast—these keep you current.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="callout-try">
          <div class="callout-title"><i data-lucide="hand"></i> Try This</div>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
            <strong>Try This</strong> boxes give you hands-on activities to practice what you're
            learning. The best way to understand AI is to use it.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="callout callout-warning">
          <div class="callout-title">Warning</div>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
            <strong>Warnings</strong> highlight safety-critical information you shouldn't skip.
            These are the "this could seriously affect your health" moments.
          </p>
        </div>

        <details class="learn-more">
          <summary>Learn More: Want to go deeper?</summary>
          <div class="learn-more-content">
            <p>
              Throughout the guide, you'll find expandable "Learn More" sections like this one.
              They're optional—the main content gives you everything you need. But if you're
              curious about the details, click to expand.
            </p>
            <p>
              These sections often include more technical explanations, additional context,
              or nuances that might interest some readers but aren't essential for everyone.
            </p>
          </div>
        </details>

        <h3>Sources and Citations</h3>
        <p>
          When we make specific claims—especially statistics or research findings—we provide
          sources so you can verify the information yourself. This is the same standard we
          encourage you to apply to AI: don't just trust, verify.

        <h2>Who This Guide Is For</h2>

        <p>This guide is for you if:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>You've used or want to use AI tools like ChatGPT for health questions</li>
          <li>You're managing a chronic condition and want AI to help you stay informed</li>
          <li>You're a caregiver helping a family member navigate healthcare</li>

        </ul>

        <p>
          You don't need any technical background. You don't need to be "good with computers."
          If you can use a smartphone or search the internet, you have all the skills you need.
        </p>

        <h3>What This Guide Is NOT</h3>
        <p>
          This is not medical advice. We are not doctors, and this guide is not a substitute
          for professional medical care. AI tools are not a replacement for your doctor, nurse
          practitioner, or other healthcare providers.
        </p>
        <p>
          This guide helps you use AI as one tool among many—while knowing its limits and when
          to seek real medical care. If you have a medical concern, talk to your healthcare
          provider. If you're experiencing an emergency, call 911.

            Never delay seeking medical care because you're waiting for AI to give you an answer.
            If something feels wrong, contact your healthcare provider or go to an emergency room.
            AI cannot examine you, run tests, or provide treatment.
