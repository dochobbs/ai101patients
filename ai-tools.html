        <h2>The AI Landscape</h2>

        <p>
          There are now dozens of AI tools available, and it can be overwhelming to know
          which to use. This guide focuses on the ones people actually use for health
          questions—and what each is good (and not good) at.
        </p>

        <p>
          The AI landscape is evolving rapidly. New tools launch every month, existing tools
          add new features, and the capabilities keep improving. Rather than trying to track
          every new release, this module will help you understand the major categories of
          tools and how to evaluate any AI tool for health use.
        </p>

            No single AI tool is "best" for everything. Different tools have different strengths.
            Knowing what each does well helps you pick the right one for your question.

          <div class="learn-more-content">
            <p>
              Even though many AI chatbots seem similar on the surface, they differ in important ways:
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Training data:</strong> Different companies train their AI on different data sets.
              This affects what the AI knows and how it responds.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Safety guardrails:</strong> Companies implement different levels of caution around
              health topics. Some AI tools are more willing to discuss symptoms; others are more cautious.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Web access:</strong> Some tools can search the internet for current information;
              others only know what was in their training data.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Integrations:</strong> Tools like ChatGPT Health can connect to your actual
              medical records, while others can only work with information you type in.

          <summary>Learn More: Free vs. paid tiers - is it worth upgrading?</summary>
          <div class="learn-more-content">
            <p>
              Most AI chatbots offer both free and paid options. Here's what you typically get with paid subscriptions:
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Better models:</strong> Paid tiers often give access to more advanced AI models
              that are more accurate and capable of complex reasoning.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Faster responses:</strong> During busy times, free users may experience delays
              or be temporarily limited. Paid users get priority.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>More features:</strong> Advanced features like image analysis, longer conversations,
              and integrations (like ChatGPT Health) may require paid subscriptions.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Higher limits:</strong> Free tiers often have limits on how many questions
              you can ask per day. Paid removes or raises these limits.
            </p>
            <p>
              For occasional health questions, free tiers are usually sufficient. If you're managing
              a chronic condition or using AI regularly for health research, paid tiers may be worth it.

            <strong>2025-2026:</strong> AI search has become mainstream. Most people now encounter
            AI-generated health information whether they're specifically seeking it or not,
            just by using regular search engines. This makes understanding how to evaluate
            AI-generated content more important than ever.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Using AI Search for Health Research</h3>
        <p>
          When using AI search tools like Perplexity for health questions, follow these practices:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Check the sources:</strong> Click through to verify the information comes from reputable medical sites</li>
          <li><strong>Look for medical sources:</strong> Prefer answers that cite Mayo Clinic, Cleveland Clinic, NIH, CDC, or medical journals</li>
          <li><strong>Be wary of single sources:</strong> The best answers synthesize information from multiple reliable sources</li>
          <li><strong>Note the date:</strong> Medical information can become outdated; check when sources were published</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="callout-try">
          <div class="callout-title"><i data-lucide="hand"></i> Try This</div>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
            Try the same health question in both a regular chatbot (like ChatGPT) and an AI search tool
            (like Perplexity). Notice how Perplexity shows you exactly where the information came from,
            while ChatGPT doesn't always cite sources. Consider which approach works better for different
            types of questions.

            If you have a medical document you're trying to understand (like discharge instructions),
            try uploading it to NotebookLM and asking: "What are the most important things I need
            to do based on this document?" Then ask: "Explain the medical terms in this document
            in simple language."
          </p>
        </div>

        <details class="learn-more">
          <summary>Learn More: How NotebookLM reduces AI errors</summary>
          <div class="learn-more-content">
            <p>
              One of the biggest problems with AI is "hallucination" - making up information
              that sounds plausible but isn't true. NotebookLM addresses this by limiting
              the AI to only the documents you upload.
            </p>
            <p>
              When you ask NotebookLM a question, it can only answer based on the text in
              your uploaded documents. It will tell you if the answer isn't in the documents
              rather than making something up.
            </p>
            <p>
              This makes it especially useful for:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Understanding your medical records or test results</li>
              <li>Summarizing long research articles about your condition</li>
              <li>Finding specific information in discharge instructions</li>
              <li>Comparing information across multiple documents</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The tradeoff is that NotebookLM can't provide general medical context or
              explain things not mentioned in your documents. For that, you'd use a
              general chatbot alongside NotebookLM.

          <summary>Learn More: Should I use health-specific AI vs. general chatbots?</summary>
          <div class="learn-more-content">
            <p>
              Health-specific tools like Ada are designed with medical input and often have
              better safety guardrails. They're usually better for symptom checking.
            </p>
            <p>
              General chatbots like ChatGPT are more flexible—you can ask anything—but have
              less medical-specific safety features. They're often better for general learning
              and preparing questions.
            </p>
            <p>
              For symptom questions: consider health-specific tools first.
              For understanding and learning: general chatbots work well.
              For anything serious: talk to a real healthcare provider.

          <summary>Learn More: How symptom checker AI works</summary>
          <div class="learn-more-content">
            <p>
              Symptom checker apps like Ada use a combination of AI and medical knowledge bases.
              When you describe your symptoms, the AI:
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Asks clarifying questions:</strong> Unlike general chatbots, symptom checkers
              follow structured protocols to gather the specific information doctors would want to know.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Considers probability:</strong> They rank possible conditions by how likely
              they are, not just whether they're possible. A headache is more likely to be tension
              than a brain tumor.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Account for red flags:</strong> They're programmed to recognize warning signs
              that need immediate medical attention and will tell you to seek emergency care.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, even the best symptom checkers are only as good as the information you provide,
              and they cannot examine you. They're best used as a first step to help you decide
              if and how urgently you need to see a doctor.

        <h2>Emerging Tools to Watch</h2>
        <p>
          The AI health landscape is evolving rapidly. Here are some emerging categories and tools
          to be aware of:
        </p>

        <h3>Voice-Based AI Assistants</h3>
        <p>
          AI assistants like Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant are adding more health features.
          You can ask basic health questions, set medication reminders, and in some cases,
          get health information read aloud. These are convenient but generally less capable
          than dedicated health AI tools.
        </p>

        <h3>AI in Patient Portals</h3>
        <p>
          Some healthcare systems are integrating AI into their patient portals. These AI
          assistants can help you understand your test results, schedule appointments, and
          prepare for visits—all within your healthcare provider's system.
        </p>

        <h3>Mental Health AI</h3>
        <p>
          Apps like Woebot and Wysa use AI for mental health support. They're not replacements
          for therapy but can provide cognitive behavioral techniques, mood tracking, and
          coping strategies between sessions or while waiting to see a therapist.
        </p>

        <div class="callout callout-warning">
          <div class="callout-title">Warning</div>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
            Be cautious with AI tools that make bold health claims or promise to diagnose
            conditions. Legitimate health AI tools are clear about their limitations and
            always recommend consulting healthcare providers for diagnosis and treatment.

        <h3>Questions to Ask When Evaluating Any AI Tool</h3>
        <p>
          When you encounter a new AI tool for health, ask yourself:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Who made it?</strong> Is it from a reputable company? Do they have medical advisors?</li>
          <li><strong>What are its limitations?</strong> Legitimate tools are clear about what they can't do.</li>
          <li><strong>Where does the information come from?</strong> Can you verify the sources?</li>
          <li><strong>How is my data protected?</strong> Read the privacy policy, especially for health data.</li>
          <li><strong>Does it replace or complement healthcare?</strong> Be wary of tools claiming to replace doctors.</li>
        </ul>
