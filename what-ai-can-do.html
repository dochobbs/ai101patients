        <h2>AI Is Not a Doctor</h2>

        <p>
          Let's get the most important thing out of the way first: <strong>AI is not a doctor</strong>.
          It doesn't examine you. It can't run tests. It doesn't know you as a person. And it has
          no medical license to lose if it gives you bad advice.
        </p>

        <p>
          This isn't a criticism of AI—it's just a fact about what these tools are. Understanding
          this helps you use them appropriately.
        </p>

        <div class="callout-pearl">
          <div class="callout-title"><i data-lucide="lightbulb"></i> Pearl</div>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
            Think of AI as a very knowledgeable research assistant who has read millions of medical
            articles—but has never seen a patient, can't do a physical exam, and sometimes
            confidently says things that are completely wrong.

      <section class="long-form-text">
        <h2>What AI Does Well</h2>

        <p>AI tools like ChatGPT excel at certain things:</p>

        <h3>Explaining Medical Concepts</h3>
        <p>
          AI is excellent at taking complex medical jargon and explaining it in plain language.
          Got a lab result you don't understand? AI can often explain what it means in terms
          you can actually follow.
        </p>

        <h3>Summarizing Information</h3>
        <p>
          If you have a long document—like discharge instructions or a research article—AI
          can help you pull out the key points. It's like having a very fast reader who can
          give you the highlights.
        </p>

        <h3>Generating Questions</h3>
        <p>
          Not sure what to ask your doctor? AI can help you come up with relevant questions
          based on your situation. This can make your appointments more productive.
        </p>

        <h3>Organizing Your Thoughts</h3>
        <p>
          AI can help you structure your symptoms, timeline, and concerns into a clear
          summary before you see your healthcare provider.
        </p>

        <div class="callout-try">
          <div class="callout-title"><i data-lucide="hand"></i> Try This</div>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
            Next time you have a doctor's appointment, try asking ChatGPT: "I'm seeing my doctor
            about [your concern]. What questions should I consider asking?" You might discover
            angles you hadn't thought of.

        <h2>What AI Does Poorly</h2>

        <p>AI tools have real limitations you need to know about:</p>

        <h3>Diagnosing Your Condition</h3>
        <p>
          AI cannot diagnose you. It might suggest possibilities based on symptoms you describe,
          but it can't examine you, consider your full history, or order tests. Any "diagnosis"
          from AI is really just a guess—sometimes an educated one, sometimes not.
        </p>

        <h3>Knowing When Something Is Urgent</h3>
        <p>
          AI often can't tell the difference between "this can wait until Monday" and "go to
          the ER now." It might miss subtle warning signs that a trained clinician would catch.
        </p>

        <h3>Understanding YOUR Specific Situation</h3>
        <p>
          Even with your medical records connected, AI doesn't truly understand you as a whole
          person. It doesn't know your values, your fears, your life circumstances, or the
          nuances of your health history the way your doctor does.
        </p>

        <h3>Being Right All the Time</h3>
        <p>
          AI "hallucinates"—it sometimes makes up facts, cites studies that don't exist, or
          gives advice that sounds authoritative but is completely wrong. We'll cover this
          more in the "Spotting AI Mistakes" module.
        </p>

          <div class="callout-title">Warning</div>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
            Never use AI to decide whether to go to the emergency room. Chest pain, difficulty
            breathing, sudden severe symptoms—these need real medical evaluation, not a chatbot.

        <h2>AI Is Getting Better—But It's Not There Yet</h2>

        <p>
          AI tools are improving rapidly. What couldn't be done a year ago might be possible
          today. But "getting better" doesn't mean "ready to replace your doctor."
        </p>

            <strong>Research Update:</strong> Studies show that AI combined with doctors often
            performs better than either alone. The key word is "combined"—AI works best as a
            tool that supports human medical judgment, not replaces it.

          <div class="learn-more-content">
            <p>
              AI language models are designed to produce fluent, confident-sounding text. This is
              a feature, not a bug—it makes them useful for many tasks. But it also means they
              sound equally confident whether they're right or wrong.
            </p>
            <p>
              Unlike a doctor who might say "I'm not sure, let me look that up," AI often
              presents uncertain information with the same confident tone as well-established
              facts. This is why verification is so important.
