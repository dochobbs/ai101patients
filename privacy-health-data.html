        <h2>The Privacy Gap You Need to Know About</h2>

        <p>
          Here's something that surprises many people: <strong>When you share your health information
          with AI tools like ChatGPT, it's not protected by HIPAA.</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          HIPAA (the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) is the law that protects
          your medical records at your doctor's office, hospital, or insurance company. It limits
          who can see your data and what they can do with it.
        </p>

        <p>
          But HIPAA only applies to "covered entities"—healthcare providers, health plans, and
          their business partners. <strong>AI companies like OpenAI are not covered entities.</strong>
        </p>

        <div class="callout callout-warning">
          <div class="callout-title">Warning</div>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
            When you type your health information into ChatGPT or connect your medical records
            to ChatGPT Health, that data is no longer protected by HIPAA. The AI company's
            privacy policy—not federal law—determines what happens to it.
          </p>

      <section class="long-form-text">
        <h2>What OpenAI Says About Your Health Data</h2>

        <p>
          To be fair, OpenAI has made specific promises about ChatGPT Health:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Separate storage:</strong> Your health conversations are kept in a dedicated space, isolated from your other ChatGPT chats</li>
          <li><strong>Not used for training:</strong> OpenAI says health data won't be used to train their AI models</li>
          <li><strong>Encryption:</strong> Data is encrypted both when stored and when transmitted</li>
          <li><strong>You control what's shared:</strong> You decide which records to connect and can disconnect anytime</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="callout-news">
          <div class="callout-title"><i data-lucide="newspaper"></i> In the News</div>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
            <strong>January 2026:</strong> OpenAI partners with b.well to connect medical records.
            The integration uses "consumer-mediated access"—meaning you explicitly authorize
            what's shared. You can revoke access at any time.
          </p>
        </div>

        <p>
          These are good practices. But here's the catch: <strong>these are company policies,
          not legal requirements.</strong> They could change. And if something goes wrong,
          your legal protections are limited compared to what you'd have under HIPAA.

        <h2>Making Informed Choices</h2>

        <p>
          Privacy isn't all-or-nothing. Here are ways to use AI for health while managing your exposure:
        </p>

        <h3>Option 1: Don't Connect Your Records</h3>
        <p>
          You can use ChatGPT for health questions without connecting your medical records.
          Just type in your questions. This limits what the AI knows but also limits your privacy exposure.
        </p>

        <h3>Option 2: Connect Records Selectively</h3>
        <p>
          ChatGPT Health lets you choose what to share. You might connect recent lab results
          but not your full medical history. You control the scope.
        </p>

        <h3>Option 3: Full Integration with Eyes Open</h3>
        <p>
          If you decide the benefits outweigh the privacy trade-offs, connect everything—but
          understand what you're agreeing to. Read the privacy policy. Know you can disconnect later.
        </p>

        <div class="callout-try">
          <div class="callout-title"><i data-lucide="hand"></i> Try This</div>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
            Before connecting any health data, find and read the privacy policy for the AI tool
            you're using. Look specifically for: What data is collected? How long is it stored?
            Is it used for training? Can you delete it?
          </p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <div class="section-divider"></div>

      <section class="long-form-text">
        <h2>Questions to Ask Yourself</h2>

        <p>Before sharing health information with any AI tool, consider:</p>

        <ol>
          <li><strong>What's the benefit?</strong> What will I gain from sharing this specific information?</li>
          <li><strong>What's the risk?</strong> What could go wrong if this data were exposed or misused?</li>
          <li><strong>Is it necessary?</strong> Could I get similar help without sharing this particular data?</li>
          <li><strong>Do I trust this company?</strong> Does their track record give me confidence?</li>
          <li><strong>Can I undo it?</strong> If I change my mind, can I delete my data and disconnect?</li>
        </ol>

        <details class="learn-more">
          <summary>Learn More: What about other AI tools?</summary>
          <div class="learn-more-content">
            <p>
              The same principles apply to other AI chatbots—Claude, Gemini, Copilot, and others.
              None of them are covered by HIPAA. Each has its own privacy policy with different terms.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some tools are more privacy-focused than others. Some let you opt out of training.
              Some delete your data automatically after a period. Always check before sharing
              sensitive health information.
            </p>

      <div class="section-divider"></div>

      <section class="long-form-text">
        <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

        <p>
          AI tools can be genuinely helpful for your health. But the privacy landscape is different
          from what you're used to with your doctor's office.
        </p>

        <p>
          This doesn't mean "don't use AI for health"—it means "use it thoughtfully." Understand
          the trade-offs. Make informed choices. And remember: you're always in control of what
          you share.
        </p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
            Your health data is valuable—to you, and potentially to others. Treat sharing it
            with AI the same way you'd treat sharing it with anyone else: thoughtfully,
            with clear eyes about the benefits and risks.
