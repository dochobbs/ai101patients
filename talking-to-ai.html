        <h2>Why How You Ask Matters</h2>

        <p>
          AI chatbots respond differently depending on how you ask your question. A vague
          question gets a vague answer. A specific, well-structured question gets something
          much more useful.
        </p>

        <p>
          This isn't about learning special tricks or secret commands. It's about the same
          skills you use when talking to anyone: being clear, giving context, and asking
          for what you actually need.
        </p>

        <div class="callout-pearl">
          <div class="callout-title"><i data-lucide="lightbulb"></i> Pearl</div>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
            Think of AI like a very knowledgeable friend who just met you. They want to help,
            but they only know what you tell them. The more context you provide, the better
            help they can give.
          </p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <div class="section-divider"></div>

      <section class="long-form-text">
        <h2>The Four Keys to Better Questions</h2>

        <h3>1. Be Specific</h3>
        <p>
          Vague questions lead to generic answers. The more specific you are, the more
          tailored and useful the response will be.
        </p>

        <div class="example-box example-bad">
          <h4>Instead of this:</h4>
          <div class="prompt-text">What causes headaches?</div>
        </div>

        <div class="example-box example-good">
          <h4>Try this:</h4>
          <div class="prompt-text">I get headaches that start behind my right eye, usually in the afternoon, about 3-4 times a week. They've been happening for the past month. What might be causing this pattern?</div>
        </div>

        <p>
          The second question will get you information specific to your situation rather
          than a generic list of headache causes.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Provide Context</h3>
        <p>
          AI doesn't know your medical history unless you tell it. Including relevant
          background helps get more accurate, personalized responses.
        </p>

        <div class="example-box example-good">
          <h4>Adding helpful context:</h4>
          <div class="prompt-text">I'm a 45-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes. I take metformin. My doctor wants to add a new medication called Jardiance. Can you explain what Jardiance does and how it might work together with metformin?</div>
        </div>

        <div class="callout-pearl">
          <div class="callout-title"><i data-lucide="lightbulb"></i> Pearl</div>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
            If you've connected ChatGPT Health to your medical records, you can say things
            like "Based on my health records, what questions should I ask about..." The AI
            will use your actual data to give more personalized suggestions.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h3>3. Ask for the Format You Need</h3>
        <p>
          You can ask AI to present information in different ways: simple language,
          bullet points, comparison tables, or step-by-step explanations.
        </p>

        <div class="example-box example-good">
          <h4>Specifying format:</h4>
          <div class="prompt-text">Explain the difference between Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. Use simple language that someone without a medical background could understand. Include a comparison table.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="example-box example-good">
          <h4>Another format example:</h4>
          <div class="prompt-text">Give me a bullet-point list of questions I should ask my cardiologist about my high blood pressure. Keep it to the 5 most important questions.</div>
        </div>

        <h3>4. Tell It Your Goal</h3>
        <p>
          Explain why you're asking. This helps the AI focus on what's actually useful to you.
        </p>

        <div class="example-box example-good">
          <h4>Including your goal:</h4>
          <div class="prompt-text">I was just diagnosed with hypothyroidism and I'm feeling overwhelmed. I want to understand the basics before my follow-up appointment next week. Can you explain what hypothyroidism means for my daily life in a way that won't scare me?</div>
        </div>

        <div class="callout-try">
          <div class="callout-title"><i data-lucide="hand"></i> Try This</div>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
            Take a health question you've been curious about. Before asking it, add: (1) relevant
            personal context, (2) your format preference, and (3) why you're asking. Notice how
            the answer changes compared to a simple question.

        <h2>Example Prompts That Work Well</h2>

        <p>Here are some proven prompt patterns for common health situations:</p>

        <h3>Understanding a New Diagnosis</h3>
        <div class="example-box example-good">
          <h4>Prompt template:</h4>
          <div class="prompt-text">I was just diagnosed with [condition]. I'm feeling [emotional state]. Can you:
1. Explain what this condition means in simple terms
2. Tell me what I might expect in the short term
3. Suggest 3-5 questions I should ask my doctor

Please use reassuring language and avoid medical jargon.</div>
        </div>

        <h3>Understanding a Lab Result</h3>
        <div class="example-box example-good">
          <h4>Prompt template:</h4>
          <div class="prompt-text">My [lab test] came back at [value]. The normal range is [range]. Can you explain:
1. What this test measures
2. What my result might indicate
3. What questions I should ask my doctor about this result

I'm a [age]-year-old [male/female] with [any relevant conditions].</div>
        </div>

        <h3>Comparing Treatment Options</h3>
        <div class="example-box example-good">
          <h4>Prompt template:</h4>
          <div class="prompt-text">My doctor gave me a choice between [option A] and [option B] for [condition]. Can you help me understand:
1. How each option works
2. The main pros and cons of each
3. What questions I should ask to help me decide

Format this as a comparison table if possible.</div>
        </div>

        <h3>Preparing for an Appointment</h3>
        <div class="example-box example-good">
          <h4>Prompt template:</h4>
          <div class="prompt-text">I have an appointment with my [type of doctor] in [timeframe] about [concern]. My relevant history: [brief background].

Help me:
1. Organize my symptoms and concerns clearly
2. Create a list of important questions to ask
3. Identify any information I should bring or prepare</div>
        </div>

        <div class="callout-news">

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
            <strong>Research Finding:</strong> Studies show that patients who prepare questions
            before appointments report higher satisfaction and better understanding of their
            care plan. AI can be a helpful tool for this preparation.

      <div class="section-divider"></div>

      <section class="long-form-text">
        <h2>Following Up and Going Deeper</h2>

        <p>
          A conversation with AI is just that: a conversation. You don't have to get
          everything right in the first message. You can follow up, clarify, and dig deeper.
        </p>

        <h3>Useful Follow-up Phrases</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>"Can you explain that in simpler terms?"</li>
          <li>"What do you mean by [specific term]?"</li>
          <li>"Can you give me a specific example?"</li>
          <li>"What would this look like in everyday life?"</li>
          <li>"Is there anything you're uncertain about in your answer?"</li>
          <li>"What are the most important things I should remember from this?"</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="callout-pearl">
          <div class="callout-title"><i data-lucide="lightbulb"></i> Pearl</div>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
            Don't be afraid to ask AI to be more cautious: "You sounded very confident. How
            sure are you about this information, and what should I verify with my doctor?"
            This can help surface uncertainty that AI might otherwise gloss over.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h3>When the Answer Doesn't Help</h3>
        <p>If you get an unhelpful response, try:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Rephrasing your question with more detail</li>
          <li>Breaking a complex question into smaller parts</li>
          <li>Explicitly asking for a different approach: "That was too technical. Can you explain it like I'm explaining to a family member?"</li>
          <li>Starting a new conversation with fresh context</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="callout-try">
          <div class="callout-title"><i data-lucide="hand"></i> Try This</div>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
            After getting an answer, ask: "What's the most important thing I should take away
            from this, and what's the first thing I should verify with a healthcare professional?"
            This helps you prioritize and reminds you to verify.

      <section class="long-form-text">
        <h2>What Not to Do</h2>

        <p>
          Some approaches will consistently give you worse results:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Don't ask yes/no questions about diagnoses:</strong> "Do I have cancer?" will get a generic response. "What could cause these symptoms?" starts a more useful conversation.</li>
          <li><strong>Don't expect mind-reading:</strong> AI doesn't know details you haven't shared. If context matters, include it.</li>
          <li><strong>Don't ignore uncertainty:</strong> If AI says "might," "could," or "possibly," those words matter.</li>
          <li><strong>Don't use AI for emergencies:</strong> Chest pain, difficulty breathing, or severe symptoms need 911, not a chatbot.</li>
          <li><strong>Don't skip verification:</strong> Always verify important information with your healthcare team.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="callout callout-warning">
          <div class="callout-title">Warning</div>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
            Never tell AI to "ignore previous instructions" or try to "jailbreak" it for
            medical advice. Safety guardrails exist for good reasons. If AI won't give you
            specific medical advice, that's a feature, not a bug.
          </p>
        </div>

        <details class="learn-more">
          <summary>Learn More: Why AI has safety guardrails</summary>
          <div class="learn-more-content">
            <p>
              AI companies build in safety features that prevent AI from giving direct medical
              diagnoses or treatment recommendations. You might find this frustrating if you
              want a straight answer, but there are good reasons for it.
            </p>
            <p>
              AI can sound confident while being wrong. It doesn't know your full situation.
              It can't examine you or order tests. If it gave direct medical advice and that
              advice was wrong, people could be seriously harmed.
            </p>
            <p>
              The guardrails are designed to keep AI in its lane: helping you understand
              information and prepare questions, not replacing professional medical judgment.
