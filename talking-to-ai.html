        <h2>Why How You Ask Matters</h2>

        <p>
          AI chatbots respond differently depending on how you ask your question. A vague
          question gets a vague answer. A specific, well-structured question gets something
          much more useful.
        </p>

        <p>
          This isn't about learning special tricks or secret commands. It's about the same
          skills you use when talking to anyone: being clear, giving context, and asking
          for what you actually need.
        </p>

        <p>
          The way you communicate with AI is sometimes called "prompting." While there's
          a whole industry around "prompt engineering," you don't need to be an expert.
          The basic principles are intuitive once you understand how AI works.
        </p>

        <div class="callout-pearl">
          <div class="callout-title"><i data-lucide="lightbulb"></i> Pearl</div>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
            Think of AI like a very knowledgeable friend who just met you. They want to help,
            but they only know what you tell them. The more context you provide, the better
            help they can give.
          </p>
        </div>

        <details class="learn-more">
          <summary>Learn More: Why AI responds differently to different prompts</summary>
          <div class="learn-more-content">
            <p>
              AI chatbots work by predicting what response would be most helpful given your
              input. When you provide more specific, detailed information, the AI has more
              to work with in crafting its response.
            </p>
            <p>
              Think of it like asking directions. "How do I get there?" requires guessing
              where "there" is and where you're starting from. "How do I get from downtown
              Chicago to O'Hare Airport using public transit?" gives everything needed
              for a useful answer.
            </p>
            <p>
              The same principle applies to health questions. "Why am I tired?" could have
              thousands of answers. "I'm a 45-year-old woman who sleeps 7 hours but wakes
              up tired, especially on days after I eat late. What might explain this?"
              narrows it down significantly.

      <div class="section-divider"></div>

      <section class="long-form-text">
        <h2>The Four Keys to Better Questions</h2>

        <h3>1. Be Specific</h3>
        <p>
          Vague questions lead to generic answers. The more specific you are, the more
          tailored and useful the response will be.
        </p>

        <div class="example-box example-bad">
          <h4>Instead of this:</h4>
          <div class="prompt-text">What causes headaches?</div>
        </div>

        <div class="example-box example-good">
          <h4>Try this:</h4>
          <div class="prompt-text">I get headaches that start behind my right eye, usually in the afternoon, about 3-4 times a week. They've been happening for the past month. What might be causing this pattern?</div>
        </div>

        <p>
          The second question will get you information specific to your situation rather
          than a generic list of headache causes.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Provide Context</h3>
        <p>
          AI doesn't know your medical history unless you tell it. Including relevant
          background helps get more accurate, personalized responses.
        </p>

        <div class="example-box example-good">
          <h4>Adding helpful context:</h4>
          <div class="prompt-text">I'm a 45-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes. I take metformin. My doctor wants to add a new medication called Jardiance. Can you explain what Jardiance does and how it might work together with metformin?</div>
        </div>

        <p>
          Context that can be helpful includes:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Your age and sex</li>
          <li>Relevant medical conditions</li>
          <li>Current medications</li>
          <li>Family history (if relevant)</li>
          <li>Lifestyle factors (activity level, diet, sleep patterns)</li>
          <li>What treatments you've already tried</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="callout-pearl">
          <div class="callout-title"><i data-lucide="lightbulb"></i> Pearl</div>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
            If you've connected ChatGPT Health to your medical records, you can say things
            like "Based on my health records, what questions should I ask about..." The AI
            will use your actual data to give more personalized suggestions.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h3>3. Ask for the Format You Need</h3>
        <p>
          You can ask AI to present information in different ways: simple language,
          bullet points, comparison tables, or step-by-step explanations.
        </p>

        <div class="example-box example-good">
          <h4>Specifying format:</h4>
          <div class="prompt-text">Explain the difference between Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. Use simple language that someone without a medical background could understand. Include a comparison table.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="example-box example-good">
          <h4>Another format example:</h4>
          <div class="prompt-text">Give me a bullet-point list of questions I should ask my cardiologist about my high blood pressure. Keep it to the 5 most important questions.</div>
        </div>

        <p>
          Format options to consider:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Simple language:</strong> "Explain this like I'm explaining to a family member"</li>
          <li><strong>Bullet points:</strong> Easier to scan and remember</li>
          <li><strong>Tables:</strong> Great for comparing options</li>
          <li><strong>Step-by-step:</strong> Helpful for procedures or processes</li>
          <li><strong>Summary:</strong> When you want the key points only</li>
          <li><strong>Detailed:</strong> When you want comprehensive information</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4. Tell It Your Goal</h3>
        <p>
          Explain why you're asking. This helps the AI focus on what's actually useful to you.
        </p>

        <div class="example-box example-good">
          <h4>Including your goal:</h4>
          <div class="prompt-text">I was just diagnosed with hypothyroidism and I'm feeling overwhelmed. I want to understand the basics before my follow-up appointment next week. Can you explain what hypothyroidism means for my daily life in a way that won't scare me?</div>
        </div>

        <p>
          Stating your goal helps in several ways:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The AI adjusts its tone (reassuring vs. clinical)</li>
          <li>It focuses on actionable information</li>
          <li>It avoids overwhelming you with irrelevant details</li>
          <li>It can structure information to meet your needs</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="callout-try">
          <div class="callout-title"><i data-lucide="hand"></i> Try This</div>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
            Take a health question you've been curious about. Before asking it, add: (1) relevant
            personal context, (2) your format preference, and (3) why you're asking. Notice how
            the answer changes compared to a simple question.
          </p>

        <p>Here are some proven prompt patterns for common health situations:</p>

        <h3>Understanding a New Diagnosis</h3>

              Once you find prompts that work well for you, save them for reuse. You can
              create templates for situations you encounter regularly:
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>For chronic conditions:</strong> Create a template that includes your
              condition, current medications, and typical concerns.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>For recurring appointments:</strong> Create a pre-appointment template
              with your standard context already filled in.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>For medication questions:</strong> Keep a template that asks about
              interactions, timing, and side effects.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can save these in a notes app and copy-paste them when needed, filling

      <section class="long-form-text">
        <h2>Following Up and Going Deeper</h2>

        <p>
          A conversation with AI is just that: a conversation. You don't have to get
          everything right in the first message. You can follow up, clarify, and dig deeper.
        </p>

        <h3>Useful Follow-up Phrases</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>"Can you explain that in simpler terms?"</li>
          <li>"What do you mean by [specific term]?"</li>
          <li>"Can you give me a specific example?"</li>
          <li>"What would this look like in everyday life?"</li>
          <li>"Is there anything you're uncertain about in your answer?"</li>
          <li>"What are the most important things I should remember from this?"</li>
          <li>"Can you summarize that in 2-3 sentences?"</li>
          <li>"What else should I know that I haven't asked about?"</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Probing for Uncertainty</h3>
        <p>
          AI often sounds more confident than it should be. You can ask it to acknowledge
          uncertainty directly:
        </p>

        <div class="example-box example-good">
          <h4>Asking about confidence:</h4>
          <div class="prompt-text">You sounded very confident in that answer. How sure are you about this information? What parts should I definitely verify with my doctor?</div>
        </div>

        <div class="callout-pearl">
          <div class="callout-title"><i data-lucide="lightbulb"></i> Pearl</div>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
            Don't be afraid to ask AI to be more cautious: "You sounded very confident. How
            sure are you about this information, and what should I verify with my doctor?"
            This can help surface uncertainty that AI might otherwise gloss over.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h3>When the Answer Doesn't Help</h3>
        <p>If you get an unhelpful response, try:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Rephrasing your question with more detail</li>
          <li>Breaking a complex question into smaller parts</li>
          <li>Explicitly asking for a different approach: "That was too technical. Can you explain it like I'm explaining to a family member?"</li>
          <li>Starting a new conversation with fresh context</li>
          <li>Asking a different AI tool (different tools have different strengths)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Building on Previous Answers</h3>
        <p>
          AI remembers what you've discussed in the same conversation. Use this to go deeper:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>"Based on what we just discussed, what should I do next?"</li>
          <li>"Given my situation, which of those options makes the most sense?"</li>
          <li>"Can you relate that to what you said earlier about [topic]?"</li>
          <li>"Now that you understand my background, what questions should I ask my doctor?"</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="callout-try">
          <div class="callout-title"><i data-lucide="hand"></i> Try This</div>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
            After getting an answer, ask: "What's the most important thing I should take away
            from this, and what's the first thing I should verify with a healthcare professional?"
            This helps you prioritize and reminds you to verify.

          Some health topics feel more sensitive or embarrassing to discuss. One advantage
          of AI is that you can ask about anything without judgment. However, there are
          still considerations:
        </p>

        <h3>Privacy Considerations</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Remember that your conversations may be stored (unless you use temporary chat mode)</li>
          <li>For very sensitive topics, consider using temporary/private chat modes</li>
          <li>Don't include identifying information you don't need to share</li>
          <li>Be aware of who might have access to your devices</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Getting Useful Answers on Sensitive Topics</h3>
        <p>
          AI is often cautious about sensitive health topics. If you're getting overly
          generic responses, try being more specific about what you need:
        </p>

        <div class="example-box example-good">
          <h4>Being specific about sensitive topics:</h4>
          <div class="prompt-text">I'm experiencing [sensitive symptom]. I've been hesitant to bring this up with my doctor because [reason]. Can you:
1. Help me understand if this is something I should see a doctor about
2. Suggest how I might bring this up with my doctor
3. Explain what kind of doctor would be appropriate to see

I'm looking for practical guidance, not just "see a doctor."</div>

              AI can be helpful for learning about mental health conditions, understanding
              treatment options, and preparing for appointments. However, it has limitations:
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>What AI can help with:</strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Explaining mental health conditions in accessible terms</li>
              <li>Describing what therapy or treatment might involve</li>
              <li>Helping you organize your thoughts before a mental health appointment</li>
              <li>Providing coping strategies based on established techniques</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              <strong>What AI cannot do:</strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Provide therapy or mental health treatment</li>
              <li>Diagnose mental health conditions</li>
              <li>Replace ongoing care from a mental health professional</li>
              <li>Provide crisis intervention</li>

              <strong>In crisis:</strong> If you're experiencing a mental health crisis,
              please contact a crisis line or emergency services. AI is not appropriate
              for crisis support.

        <h2>What Not to Do</h2>

        <p>
          Some approaches will consistently give you worse results:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Don't ask yes/no questions about diagnoses:</strong> "Do I have cancer?" will get a generic response. "What could cause these symptoms?" starts a more useful conversation.</li>
          <li><strong>Don't expect mind-reading:</strong> AI doesn't know details you haven't shared. If context matters, include it.</li>
          <li><strong>Don't ignore uncertainty:</strong> If AI says "might," "could," or "possibly," those words matter.</li>
          <li><strong>Don't use AI for emergencies:</strong> Chest pain, difficulty breathing, or severe symptoms need 911, not a chatbot.</li>
          <li><strong>Don't skip verification:</strong> Always verify important information with your healthcare team.</li>
          <li><strong>Don't argue with AI:</strong> If you disagree with an answer, rephrase your question rather than arguing.</li>
          <li><strong>Don't share more than necessary:</strong> You can be specific without including identifying information you don't need to share.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="callout callout-warning">
          <div class="callout-title">Warning</div>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
            Never tell AI to "ignore previous instructions" or try to "jailbreak" it for
            medical advice. Safety guardrails exist for good reasons. If AI won't give you
            specific medical advice, that's a feature, not a bug.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Common Mistakes That Lead to Poor Answers</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Being too brief:</strong> "Should I worry?" gives AI nothing to work with</li>
          <li><strong>Being too lengthy:</strong> Very long messages may bury the actual question</li>
          <li><strong>Multiple unrelated questions:</strong> Ask one topic at a time for better focus</li>
          <li><strong>Leading questions:</strong> "Isn't it true that..." pushes AI toward what you want to hear</li>
          <li><strong>Expecting diagnosis:</strong> AI is trained not to diagnose, so don't expect it to</li>
        </ul>

        <details class="learn-more">
          <summary>Learn More: Why AI has safety guardrails</summary>
          <div class="learn-more-content">
            <p>
              AI companies build in safety features that prevent AI from giving direct medical
              diagnoses or treatment recommendations. You might find this frustrating if you
              want a straight answer, but there are good reasons for it.
            </p>
            <p>
              AI can sound confident while being wrong. It doesn't know your full situation.
              It can't examine you or order tests. If it gave direct medical advice and that
              advice was wrong, people could be seriously harmed.
            </p>
            <p>
              The guardrails are designed to keep AI in its lane: helping you understand
              information and prepare questions, not replacing professional medical judgment.
            </p>
            <p>
              When AI says "consult a healthcare provider," it's not being unhelpful—it's
              recognizing the limits of what it can safely do.
            </p>

          <summary>Learn More: What to do when AI seems too cautious</summary>
          <div class="learn-more-content">
            <p>
              Sometimes AI refuses to engage with questions that seem perfectly reasonable.
              This happens because the guardrails are intentionally broad to avoid edge cases.
            </p>
            <p>
              If this happens, try:
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Reframe as education:</strong> "I'm trying to understand [topic] in
              general terms" rather than "What should I do about..."
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Ask for information, not advice:</strong> "What are the typical
              treatments for [condition]?" rather than "Should I get [treatment]?"
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Focus on preparation:</strong> "Help me prepare questions for my
              doctor about [topic]" positions AI as a preparation tool.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Be explicit about your intent:</strong> "I'm not asking for medical
              advice, I'm trying to understand the options before my appointment."
