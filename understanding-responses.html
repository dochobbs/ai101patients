        <h2>AI Sounds Confident Even When It's Wrong</h2>

        <p>
          Here's the challenge with AI: it always sounds sure of itself. Whether it's
          telling you something well-established or making something up entirely, the
          tone is the same. There's no hesitation, no "um," no change in voice that
          signals uncertainty.
        </p>

        <p>
          This means you can't rely on how confident AI sounds to judge whether it's
          right. You need to develop your own sense of what to trust and what to verify.
        </p>

        <div class="callout-pearl">
          <div class="callout-title"><i data-lucide="lightbulb"></i> Pearl</div>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
            AI is like a very confident friend who has read a lot but isn't always
            right. Just because they say something with certainty doesn't mean you
            should skip your own judgment.

        <h2>The Trust Scale: What to Trust More vs. Less</h2>

        <p>
          Not all AI responses deserve the same level of trust. Here's a general guide:
        </p>

        <div class="trust-scale">
          <div class="trust-level trust-high">
            <h4>Higher Trust</h4>
            <p>General explanations, definitions, well-known facts</p>
          </div>
          <div class="trust-level trust-medium">
            <h4>Medium Trust</h4>
            <p>Statistics, guidelines, specific recommendations</p>
          </div>
          <div class="trust-level trust-low">
            <h4>Lower Trust</h4>
            <p>Diagnoses, citations, cutting-edge research claims</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h3>What AI Generally Gets Right</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Basic explanations:</strong> What is blood pressure? How do antibiotics work? AI is usually accurate with fundamental medical concepts.</li>
          <li><strong>General descriptions:</strong> Common symptoms of flu, what to expect after a procedure, general lifestyle advice.</li>
          <li><strong>Organizing information:</strong> Summarizing what you've shared, creating lists, structuring your thoughts.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What AI Often Gets Wrong</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Specific citations:</strong> AI frequently makes up journal articles, studies, or statistics that don't exist.</li>
          <li><strong>Current guidelines:</strong> Medical guidelines change. AI's training data has a cutoff, and recommendations may be outdated.</li>
          <li><strong>Your specific situation:</strong> AI doesn't know the nuances of your case the way your doctor does.</li>
          <li><strong>Drug interactions:</strong> AI might miss important interactions or overstate minor ones.</li>
          <li><strong>Rare conditions:</strong> Less common conditions have less training data, leading to more errors.</li>
        </ul>

            <strong>Research Finding:</strong> Studies show AI chatbots frequently "hallucinate"
            medical citations - inventing journal articles and studies that don't exist. One

          Certain patterns in AI responses should trigger extra skepticism:

          <h4><i data-lucide="alert-triangle"></i> Red Flags in AI Responses</h4>
          <ul style="margin-bottom: 0;">

            <li><strong>Definitive statements about your condition:</strong> "You definitely have..." - AI can't diagnose you.</li>
            <li><strong>Medication dosage recommendations:</strong> AI should not be telling you how much medicine to take.</li>
            <li><strong>Claims that contradict your doctor:</strong> Your doctor knows you; AI doesn't.</li>
            <li><strong>Advice to delay seeking care:</strong> When in doubt, talk to a healthcare provider.</li>
            <li><strong>Outdated information:</strong> Medical guidance changes; AI's training has a cutoff date.</li>

            If AI tells you something that contradicts what your doctor said, don't assume
            AI is right and your doctor is wrong. Bring it up with your doctor: "I read
            something online that said X. Can you help me understand the difference?"

        <h2>How to Check AI's Sources</h2>

        <p>
          Some AI tools (like Perplexity) provide sources. Others (like ChatGPT) may
          cite sources when asked. Here's how to verify what AI tells you:
        </p>

        <div class="verification-step">
          <div class="step-icon"><i data-lucide="search"></i></div>

            <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0 0 0; color: #64748b;">
              "What sources are you basing this on?" or "Can you cite specific research?"
              If AI provides citations, verify they actually exist.
            </p>

            <strong>Check reputable medical sites</strong>
            <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0 0 0; color: #64748b;">
              Look up key claims on sites like Mayo Clinic, Cleveland Clinic, CDC, or NIH.
              These have medically reviewed content.

            <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0 0 0; color: #64748b;">
              When was the information last updated? Medical guidelines change. AI might

            After AI gives you health information, ask: "What's your confidence level on
            this, and what should I verify with a healthcare professional?" This prompts
            AI to acknowledge its limitations.

        <h2>Healthy Skepticism Without Paranoia</h2>

        <p>
          The goal isn't to distrust everything AI says. That would make it useless.
          The goal is calibrated trust: believing the right things to the right degree.
        </p>

        <h3>Good Skepticism Looks Like:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Treating AI explanations as a starting point, not final word</li>
          <li>Verifying specific claims before acting on them</li>
          <li>Asking follow-up questions when something seems unclear or surprising</li>
          <li>Discussing AI-provided information with your healthcare team</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Bad Skepticism Looks Like:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Ignoring everything AI says because "it might be wrong"</li>
          <li>Using AI's potential for error to avoid learning about your health</li>
          <li>Dismissing your doctor's advice because AI said something different</li>
        </ul>

            Think of AI like Wikipedia: a great starting point for understanding something,
            but not the final authority. Use it to learn the basics and generate questions,
            then verify important details through more authoritative sources.

        <h2>When AI Conflicts With Your Doctor</h2>

        <p>
          This will happen. You'll ask AI about something, and it will say something
          different from what your doctor told you. What do you do?
        </p>

        <h3>Step 1: Don't panic or assume either is wrong</h3>
        <p>
          Medicine is complex. There are often multiple valid approaches to the same
          problem. What's right for one patient may not be right for another.
        </p>

        <h3>Step 2: Consider the context</h3>
        <p>
          Your doctor knows things AI doesn't: your full history, your exam findings,
          how you've responded to treatments before, and your personal preferences.
          AI is giving general information; your doctor is giving personalized care.
        </p>

        <h3>Step 3: Ask your doctor about the discrepancy</h3>
        <p>
          Good doctors welcome questions. Try: "I was reading about [topic] and saw
          that some sources recommend [X]. Can you help me understand why you're
          recommending [Y] for my situation?"
        </p>

        <h3>Step 4: Trust the relationship</h3>
        <p>
          If you generally trust your doctor, lean toward their judgment. If you
          have ongoing concerns, consider getting a second opinion from another
          human clinician, not from AI.
        </p>

        <details class="learn-more">
          <summary>Learn More: Why doctors and AI might say different things</summary>
          <div class="learn-more-content">
            <p>
              There are many legitimate reasons for differences:
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Personalization:</strong> Your doctor is tailoring recommendations
              to you. AI is giving general information that applies to average patients.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Guideline variation:</strong> Different medical organizations sometimes
              have different guidelines. Your doctor follows the ones that make most sense
              for your situation.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Time lag:</strong> AI's training data has a cutoff. Guidelines may
              have changed since then.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>AI error:</strong> AI might simply be wrong. It happens.
            </p>
            <p>
              The right response is usually to discuss the discrepancy with your doctor,
              not to assume one is correct and the other wrong.

        <ul>
          <li>AI sounds confident whether it's right or wrong - don't trust based on tone alone</li>
          <li>Trust basic explanations more than specific statistics, citations, or diagnoses</li>
