        <h2>Why Preparation Matters</h2>

        <p>
          Doctor appointments are short. The average primary care visit is about 15-20 minutes,
          and that includes time for the doctor to review your chart, examine you, and document
          the visit. Your actual conversation time might be 8-10 minutes.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you walk in unprepared, it's easy to forget important symptoms, ramble about
          things that aren't priorities, or leave without asking your most important questions.
          AI can help you prepare so you make the most of every minute.
        </p>

        <div class="callout-pearl">

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
            Research shows that patients who prepare questions before appointments report
            higher satisfaction and better understanding of their care plan. AI makes this
            preparation faster and more thorough.

      <section class="long-form-text">
        <h2>Step 1: Organize Your Symptoms</h2>

        <p>
          Before your appointment, use AI to help you create a clear, organized summary
          of what's been going on. This saves time and helps your doctor understand your
          situation quickly.
        </p>

        <div class="prompt-box">
          <h4>Prompt to try:</h4>

Please format this as a brief summary I can hand to my doctor or read quickly at the start of my appointment.</div>
        </div>

        <h3>What to Include</h3>

          <li><strong>Timeline:</strong> When did this start? Has it changed over time?</li>
          <li><strong>Frequency:</strong> How often does it happen? Constant? Occasional?</li>

          <li><strong>Triggers:</strong> Does anything make it worse? Better?</li>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
            Before your next appointment, spend 5 minutes describing your symptoms to AI in
            your own words. Then ask it to organize what you said into a clear, one-paragraph
            summary. Bring that summary to your appointment.

        <h2>Step 2: Prepare Your Questions</h2>

        <p>
          You always have questions for your doctor. But under the pressure of a short
          appointment, it's easy to forget them or not know how to phrase them. AI can
          help you prepare a prioritized list.

My background: [brief relevant history - age, conditions, medications]

- Understanding my condition or symptoms
- Treatment options and what to expect
- Warning signs I should watch for
- Lifestyle changes that might help

          <li><strong>Options:</strong> "What are my treatment options, and what do you recommend?"</li>
          <li><strong>Next steps:</strong> "What should I do next? When should I follow up?"</li>
          <li><strong>Warning signs:</strong> "What symptoms should make me call you or go to the ER?"</li>
          <li><strong>Lifestyle:</strong> "Are there lifestyle changes that would help with this?"</li>
          <li><strong>Medications:</strong> "What side effects should I watch for? How long should I take this?"</li>

            Bring your question list on paper or your phone. If you run out of time, ask your
            doctor: "I have a few more questions - should I schedule another appointment, or
            can I send them through the patient portal?"
