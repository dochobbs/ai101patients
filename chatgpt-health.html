        <h2>What Is ChatGPT Health?</h2>

        <p>
          In January 2026, OpenAI launched <strong>ChatGPT Health</strong>. This feature lets you
          connect your medical records directly to ChatGPT. Once connected, you can ask
          questions about your own health data and get personalized responses.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is a big deal. Instead of typing out your entire medical history, ChatGPT can now
          see your actual lab results, medications, diagnoses, and more. It can answer questions
          like "Are any of my medications interacting badly?" or "How has my cholesterol changed
          over the past year?"
        </p>

        <div class="callout-news">
          <div class="callout-title"><i data-lucide="newspaper"></i> In the News</div>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
            <strong>January 2026:</strong> ChatGPT Health launches with access to records from
            over 2.2 million healthcare providers through b.well, plus integration with more
            than 320 health plans. OpenAI states that health data is not used to train AI models.
          </p>

      <div class="section-divider"></div>

      <section class="long-form-text">
        <h2>How It Works: The b.well Connection</h2>

        <p>
          ChatGPT Health connects to your medical records through a company called <strong>b.well</strong>.
          This is a health data platform that already works with thousands of healthcare systems.
          When you connect, b.well pulls your records and makes them available to ChatGPT.
        </p>

        <div class="data-grid">
          <div class="data-card">
            <strong>2.2M+</strong>

            <span>Pharmacies</span>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h3>What Records Can ChatGPT Access?</h3>
        <p>Once connected, ChatGPT can see:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Lab results</strong> - Blood work, imaging reports, test results</li>
          <li><strong>Medications</strong> - Current and past prescriptions</li>
          <li><strong>Diagnoses</strong> - Conditions in your medical record</li>
          <li><strong>Procedures</strong> - Surgeries, treatments you've had</li>
          <li><strong>Immunizations</strong> - Vaccine records</li>
          <li><strong>Allergies</strong> - Documented allergies and reactions</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="callout-pearl">
          <div class="callout-title"><i data-lucide="lightbulb"></i> Pearl</div>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
            ChatGPT can only see records that are in digital form and shared through the b.well
            network. Older paper records, records from providers not in the network, or information
            your doctor hasn't entered into the system won't be visible.

        <h2>Step-by-Step: Connecting Your Records</h2>

        <p>Here's how to set up ChatGPT Health:</p>

        <div class="step-box">
          <h4><span class="step-number">1</span> Open ChatGPT Settings</h4>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
            In the ChatGPT app or website, go to <strong>Settings > Personalization > Health</strong>.
            You'll see the option to "Connect health data."
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="step-box">
          <h4><span class="step-number">2</span> Sign In to b.well</h4>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
            You'll be redirected to b.well to create an account or sign in. This is where
            you'll verify your identity and authorize access to your records.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="step-box">
          <h4><span class="step-number">3</span> Find Your Healthcare Providers</h4>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
            Search for your doctors, hospitals, and clinics. You can also connect through your
            health insurance plan. Select each provider you want to connect.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="step-box">
          <h4><span class="step-number">4</span> Authorize Access</h4>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
            For each provider, you'll need to authorize b.well to access your records. This
            usually involves logging into your patient portal or verifying your identity.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="step-box">
          <h4><span class="step-number">5</span> Wait for Sync</h4>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
            Records can take anywhere from a few minutes to 24 hours to fully sync, depending
            on your providers. You'll get a notification when your data is ready.
          </p>

        <h2>Privacy Settings You Should Know</h2>

        <p>
          Connecting your health records to AI raises real privacy questions. Here's what
          you can control and what you should know:
        </p>

        <h3>What OpenAI Says About Your Data</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Not used for training:</strong> OpenAI states health data is not used to train AI models</li>
          <li><strong>Encrypted:</strong> Data is encrypted in transit and at rest</li>
          <li><strong>You control access:</strong> You can disconnect at any time</li>
          <li><strong>HIPAA considerations:</strong> b.well is HIPAA-compliant; ChatGPT itself is not a "covered entity"</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="callout callout-warning">
          <div class="callout-title">Warning</div>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
            Once you share health information in a conversation with ChatGPT, that conversation
            is stored. Even if you disconnect your health records, information you've already
            discussed may remain in your chat history. Be thoughtful about what you share.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Privacy Controls Available</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Disconnect anytime:</strong> Go to Settings > Personalization > Health to disconnect</li>
          <li><strong>Delete conversations:</strong> Remove specific chats that contain health info</li>
          <li><strong>Chat history off:</strong> You can disable chat history entirely (conversations won't be saved)</li>
          <li><strong>Temporary chat:</strong> Use temporary chat mode for sensitive questions</li>
        </ul>

        <details class="learn-more">
          <summary>Learn More: Understanding HIPAA and AI</summary>
          <div class="learn-more-content">
            <p>
              HIPAA (the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) protects your
              health information when it's held by healthcare providers and insurance companies.
              However, when you voluntarily share your data with a consumer app like ChatGPT,
              different rules apply.
            </p>
            <p>
              b.well is HIPAA-compliant, meaning they follow strict rules about protecting your
              data when they retrieve it from healthcare providers. But once you authorize
              sharing with ChatGPT, you're the one making the choice to share.
            </p>
            <p>
              This isn't necessarily bad, but it means you should be informed about what you're
              agreeing to. Read the privacy policies and understand your rights.

        <h2>Beyond Medical Records: Other Health Data</h2>

        <p>
          ChatGPT Health can also connect to wellness apps and devices, giving it access
          to data beyond your official medical records:
        </p>

        <h3>Supported Connections</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Apple Health:</strong> Steps, heart rate, sleep, workouts, and more from your iPhone or Apple Watch</li>
          <li><strong>Peloton:</strong> Workout history, heart rate during exercise, activity trends</li>
          <li><strong>MyFitnessPal:</strong> Nutrition tracking, calorie intake, meal logging</li>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
            Connecting wellness data can be useful for questions like "Based on my recent sleep
            patterns and activity, what might explain why I'm feeling tired?" But remember,
            the same privacy considerations apply. More connected data means more information
            about you in one place.

            If you use Apple Health, try connecting it to ChatGPT and asking: "Looking at my
            sleep and activity data from the past month, do you notice any patterns?" This
            can be a good way to spot trends you might have missed.

        <h2>What to Ask ChatGPT Health</h2>

        <p>Once your records are connected, here are some useful ways to use it:</p>

        <h3>Understanding Your Data</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>"Explain my most recent blood test results in simple terms."</li>
          <li>"What does my A1C level mean, and is mine in a healthy range?"</li>
          <li>"Summarize my health visits from the past year."</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Tracking Changes</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>"How has my cholesterol changed over the past three years?"</li>
          <li>"Show me the trend in my blood pressure readings."</li>
          <li>"Are there any lab values that have been consistently outside normal range?"</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Preparing for Appointments</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>"Based on my records, what questions should I ask my doctor at my next visit?"</li>
          <li>"Create a summary of my current medications and conditions for a new doctor."</li>
          <li>"What preventive screenings might I be due for based on my age and history?"</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Understanding Medications</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>"Are any of my current medications known to interact with each other?"</li>
          <li>"Explain what each of my medications is for."</li>
          <li>"What are the common side effects of my medications?"</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="callout callout-warning">
          <div class="callout-title">Warning</div>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
            Never change your medications based on ChatGPT's responses. If you have concerns
            about drug interactions or side effects, bring them up with your doctor or pharmacist.
            AI can help you identify questions to ask, not give you medical orders.

      <div class="section-divider"></div>

      <section class="long-form-text">
        <h2>What ChatGPT Health Cannot Do</h2>

        <p>
          Even with your records connected, ChatGPT has important limitations:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Cannot diagnose:</strong> It can discuss what your data might suggest, but cannot tell you what condition you have</li>
          <li><strong>Cannot prescribe:</strong> It cannot tell you what medications to take or change your treatment</li>
          <li><strong>Cannot see everything:</strong> Records not in the b.well network won't appear</li>
          <li><strong>Cannot know context:</strong> It doesn't know what you were feeling when tests were done or the full picture your doctor sees</li>
          <li><strong>Can make mistakes:</strong> It might misinterpret data or give incorrect information</li>
        </ul>

        <details class="learn-more">
          <summary>Learn More: Why AI can't replace your doctor's interpretation</summary>
          <div class="learn-more-content">
            <p>
              When your doctor looks at your lab results, they see them in context. They know
              you were dehydrated that day. They remember you mentioned stress at work. They
              can examine you and notice things that aren't in any database.
            </p>
            <p>
              AI sees numbers and text. It can pattern-match against what it's learned, but it
              lacks the human judgment that comes from actually knowing you as a person.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is why ChatGPT Health is best used as a research assistant that helps you
              understand and prepare, not as a replacement for the clinical relationship
              with your healthcare team.
