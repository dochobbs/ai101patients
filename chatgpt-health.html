        <h2>What Is ChatGPT Health?</h2>

        <p>
          In January 2026, OpenAI launched <strong>ChatGPT Health</strong>. This feature lets you
          connect your medical records directly to ChatGPT. Once connected, you can ask
          questions about your own health data and get personalized responses.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is a big deal. Instead of typing out your entire medical history, ChatGPT can now
          see your actual lab results, medications, diagnoses, and more. It can answer questions
          like "Are any of my medications interacting badly?" or "How has my cholesterol changed
          over the past year?"
        </p>

        <p>
          The feature represents a significant shift in how patients can interact with their
          health data. Previously, you might have downloaded your records and manually asked
          AI about specific values. Now, the AI can access and analyze your comprehensive
          health picture—if you choose to grant it access.
        </p>

            <strong>January 2026:</strong> ChatGPT Health launches with access to records from
            over 2.2 million healthcare providers through b.well, plus integration with more
            than 320 health plans. OpenAI states that health data is not used to train AI models.

        <h2>How It Works: The b.well Connection</h2>

        <p>
          ChatGPT Health connects to your medical records through a company called <strong>b.well Connected Health</strong>.
          This is a health data platform that already works with thousands of healthcare systems.
          When you connect, b.well pulls your records and makes them available to ChatGPT through
          FHIR-based APIs—the modern standard for healthcare data exchange.
        </p>

        <h3>Understanding FHIR and Why It Matters</h3>
        <p>
          FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) is the modern technical standard
          that allows different healthcare systems to share data. Before FHIR, getting your
          records from different doctors was often difficult because each system stored
          data differently.
        </p>

        <p>
          b.well uses FHIR-based APIs to collect your records from various healthcare
          organizations in a standardized format. This is the same technology that allows
          Apple Health to pull in your medical records and that powers many patient portal
          integrations. The standardization means ChatGPT can understand and analyze your
          records regardless of which hospital or clinic they came from.
        </p>

        <h3>What Records Can ChatGPT Access?</h3>
        <p>Once connected, ChatGPT can see:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Lab results</strong> - Blood work, imaging reports, test results</li>
          <li><strong>Medications</strong> - Current and past prescriptions</li>
          <li><strong>Diagnoses</strong> - Conditions in your medical record</li>
          <li><strong>Procedures</strong> - Surgeries, treatments you've had</li>
          <li><strong>Immunizations</strong> - Vaccine records</li>
          <li><strong>Allergies</strong> - Documented allergies and reactions</li>
          <li><strong>Vital signs</strong> - Blood pressure, weight, height over time</li>
          <li><strong>Clinical notes</strong> - In some cases, doctors' notes from visits</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="callout-pearl">
          <div class="callout-title"><i data-lucide="lightbulb"></i> Pearl</div>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
            ChatGPT can only see records that are in digital form and shared through the b.well
            network. Older paper records, records from providers not in the network, or information
            your doctor hasn't entered into the system won't be visible.

          <div class="learn-more-content">
            <p>
              b.well Connected Health is a health technology company that specializes in
              aggregating health data from multiple sources into a single platform. They've
              built connections to thousands of healthcare organizations, pharmacies, and
              health plans.
            </p>
            <p>
              The company was founded in 2015 and has focused on giving patients access to
              their own health data. Their platform allows consumers to pull their records
              from various healthcare providers and view them in one place.
            </p>
            <p>
              For the ChatGPT Health integration, b.well acts as the intermediary that
              handles the technical complexity of connecting to different healthcare systems.
              When you authorize b.well to access your records, they use industry-standard
              protocols (FHIR APIs) to retrieve your data and make it available to ChatGPT.
            </p>
            <p>
              b.well is HIPAA-compliant, meaning they follow strict federal regulations
              about protecting health information. However, when you authorize sharing
              with ChatGPT, you're making a personal choice about your data.

        </div>

        <div class="step-box">
          <h4><span class="step-number">4</span> Authorize Access</h4>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
            For each provider, you'll need to authorize b.well to access your records. This
            usually involves logging into your patient portal or verifying your identity
            through other means. Some providers may require multi-factor authentication.
          </p>

            Records can take anywhere from a few minutes to 24 hours to fully sync, depending
            on your providers. You'll get a notification when your data is ready. Some providers
            update more frequently than others.

            <p>
              If you're having trouble connecting your records, here are common issues and solutions:
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Provider not found:</strong> Not all healthcare providers are in the b.well
              network yet. If your provider isn't listed, you may need to wait for them to join
              or manually upload records.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Authorization fails:</strong> Make sure you're using the correct login
              credentials for your patient portal. If you've never set up a patient portal
              account, you may need to do that first with your provider.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Incomplete records:</strong> Some providers share more data than others.
              Recent visits may not appear immediately. If records seem incomplete, check
              back in a few days.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Old records missing:</strong> Digital record-keeping has improved over time.
              Records from many years ago may not be available electronically.

        <h2>Privacy Settings You Should Know</h2>

        <p>
          Connecting your health records to AI raises real privacy questions. Here's what
          you can control and what you should know:
        </p>

        <h3>What OpenAI Says About Your Data</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Not used for training:</strong> OpenAI states health data is not used to train AI models</li>
          <li><strong>Encrypted:</strong> Data is encrypted in transit and at rest</li>
          <li><strong>You control access:</strong> You can disconnect at any time</li>
          <li><strong>HIPAA considerations:</strong> b.well is HIPAA-compliant; ChatGPT itself is not a "covered entity"</li>
          <li><strong>Data retention:</strong> Check the privacy policy for how long data is retained</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="citation">Source: <a href="https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy" target="_blank">OpenAI Privacy Policy</a> and ChatGPT Health documentation</p>

        <div class="callout callout-warning">
          <div class="callout-title">Warning</div>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
            Once you share health information in a conversation with ChatGPT, that conversation
            is stored. Even if you disconnect your health records, information you've already
            discussed may remain in your chat history. Be thoughtful about what you share.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Privacy Controls Available</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Disconnect anytime:</strong> Go to Settings > Personalization > Health to disconnect</li>
          <li><strong>Delete conversations:</strong> Remove specific chats that contain health info</li>
          <li><strong>Chat history off:</strong> You can disable chat history entirely (conversations won't be saved)</li>
          <li><strong>Temporary chat:</strong> Use temporary chat mode for sensitive questions</li>
          <li><strong>Data export:</strong> You can request a copy of your data from OpenAI</li>
          <li><strong>Data deletion:</strong> You can request deletion of your account and associated data</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Understanding the Privacy Tradeoffs</h3>
        <p>
          There's an inherent tension between AI usefulness and privacy. For ChatGPT to give you
          personalized health insights, it needs access to your personal health data. You need to
          decide if that tradeoff makes sense for you.
        </p>

        <p>
          Consider: Are you comfortable with a technology company having access to your complete
          medical history? What's the value you're getting in return? Are there alternatives
          (like manually sharing specific information) that would work for your needs?
        </p>

        <details class="learn-more">
          <summary>Learn More: Understanding HIPAA and AI</summary>
          <div class="learn-more-content">
            <p>
              HIPAA (the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) protects your
              health information when it's held by healthcare providers and insurance companies.
              However, when you voluntarily share your data with a consumer app like ChatGPT,
              different rules apply.
            </p>
            <p>
              b.well is HIPAA-compliant, meaning they follow strict rules about protecting your
              data when they retrieve it from healthcare providers. But once you authorize
              sharing with ChatGPT, you're the one making the choice to share.
            </p>
            <p>
              This isn't necessarily bad, but it means you should be informed about what you're
              agreeing to. Read the privacy policies and understand your rights.
            </p>
            <p>
              Key things to understand:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>HIPAA applies to "covered entities" like doctors and insurers, not all tech companies</li>
              <li>When you authorize sharing, you're exercising your patient rights to your own data</li>
              <li>Consumer apps are governed by their privacy policies and terms of service</li>
              <li>The FTC can take action against companies that violate their privacy promises</li>

          <div class="learn-more-content">
            <p>
              Before connecting your health records, consider these questions:
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>What do I hope to gain?</strong> Understanding your goals helps you decide
              if the benefits outweigh the privacy considerations.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Am I comfortable with this company having my health data?</strong> Research
              the company's track record and privacy practices.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>What's the worst that could happen?</strong> Consider potential risks like
              data breaches, policy changes, or unintended uses of your data.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Are there alternatives?</strong> Could you get similar benefits by manually
              sharing specific records or using privacy-preserving approaches?
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Can I easily disconnect?</strong> Make sure you understand how to remove
              your data if you change your mind.

        <h2>Beyond Medical Records: Other Health Data</h2>

        <p>
          ChatGPT Health can also connect to wellness apps and devices, giving it access
          to data beyond your official medical records:
        </p>

        <h3>Supported Connections</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Apple Health:</strong> Steps, heart rate, sleep, workouts, and more from your iPhone or Apple Watch</li>
          <li><strong>Peloton:</strong> Workout history, heart rate during exercise, activity trends</li>
          <li><strong>MyFitnessPal:</strong> Nutrition tracking, calorie intake, meal logging</li>
          <li><strong>Oura Ring:</strong> Sleep data, readiness scores, activity tracking</li>
          <li><strong>Whoop:</strong> Strain, recovery, and sleep metrics</li>
          <li><strong>Other fitness apps:</strong> The list of supported apps continues to grow</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Combining Medical and Wellness Data</h3>
        <p>
          One powerful use case is combining your official medical records with wellness
          data. For example, you could ask: "Based on my recent blood pressure readings
          at the doctor and my activity and sleep data from my watch, what patterns
          do you notice?"
        </p>

        <p>
          This kind of holistic view wasn't easily possible before. Your doctor sees your
          clinical visits; your fitness app sees your daily activity. Now AI can help
          connect these data sources and identify patterns across them.
        </p>

        <div class="callout-pearl">
          <div class="callout-title"><i data-lucide="lightbulb"></i> Pearl</div>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
            Connecting wellness data can be useful for questions like "Based on my recent sleep
            patterns and activity, what might explain why I'm feeling tired?" But remember,
            the same privacy considerations apply. More connected data means more information
            about you in one place.
          </p>
        </div>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
            If you use Apple Health, try connecting it to ChatGPT and asking: "Looking at my
            sleep and activity data from the past month, do you notice any patterns?" This
            can be a good way to spot trends you might have missed. Then bring interesting
            findings to your doctor.

        </ul>

        <h3>Connecting Patterns</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>"Looking at my records and my fitness data, do you see any correlations?"</li>
          <li>"My energy has been low lately. Based on my recent labs and sleep data, what might explain this?"</li>
          <li>"Are there any patterns in when my symptoms seem to flare up based on my health data?"</li>
        </ul>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
            Never change your medications based on ChatGPT's responses. If you have concerns
            about drug interactions or side effects, bring them up with your doctor or pharmacist.
            AI can help you identify questions to ask, not give you medical orders.

            <p>
              Here's an example of how a productive conversation with ChatGPT Health might go:
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>You:</strong> "Based on my records, help me understand my recent lab results.
              Focus on anything that's outside normal range or has changed significantly."
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>ChatGPT:</strong> [Analyzes your connected lab results and provides a summary
              of notable values, explaining what they mean in simple terms]
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>You:</strong> "My triglycerides seem high. What does that mean and what
              questions should I ask my doctor about it?"
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>ChatGPT:</strong> [Explains triglycerides, what elevated levels might indicate,
              and suggests specific questions for your doctor]
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>You:</strong> "Looking at my records over time, has this been a consistent issue?"
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>ChatGPT:</strong> [Shows the trend in your triglyceride levels over available
              records and notes any patterns]

            <p>
              Notice how this conversation uses AI to understand and prepare, not to diagnose
              or decide on treatment.

        <h2>What ChatGPT Health Cannot Do</h2>

        <p>
          Even with your records connected, ChatGPT has important limitations:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Cannot diagnose:</strong> It can discuss what your data might suggest, but cannot tell you what condition you have</li>
          <li><strong>Cannot prescribe:</strong> It cannot tell you what medications to take or change your treatment</li>
          <li><strong>Cannot see everything:</strong> Records not in the b.well network won't appear</li>
          <li><strong>Cannot know context:</strong> It doesn't know what you were feeling when tests were done or the full picture your doctor sees</li>
          <li><strong>Can make mistakes:</strong> It might misinterpret data or give incorrect information</li>
          <li><strong>Cannot replace clinical judgment:</strong> Doctors consider many factors AI doesn't have access to</li>
          <li><strong>Cannot provide emergency care:</strong> In a medical emergency, call 911, not AI</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Understanding AI Limitations with Health Data</h3>
        <p>
          Even when AI has access to your comprehensive health records, it's working with
          incomplete information. Your health is more than data points in a database.
        </p>

        <p>
          Your doctor considers things like: How do you look today? What's your affect?
          What did you tell them about your stress levels? What do they know about your
          family situation? What's their clinical intuition based on years of experience?
        </p>

        <p>
          AI can analyze the data in your records, but it can't replace the holistic
          assessment that comes from a real clinical relationship.
        </p>

        <details class="learn-more">
          <summary>Learn More: Why AI can't replace your doctor's interpretation</summary>
          <div class="learn-more-content">
            <p>
              When your doctor looks at your lab results, they see them in context. They know
              you were dehydrated that day. They remember you mentioned stress at work. They
              can examine you and notice things that aren't in any database.
            </p>
            <p>
              AI sees numbers and text. It can pattern-match against what it's learned, but it
              lacks the human judgment that comes from actually knowing you as a person.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is why ChatGPT Health is best used as a research assistant that helps you
              understand and prepare, not as a replacement for the clinical relationship
              with your healthcare team.
            </p>
            <p>
              Consider: A slightly elevated lab value might be concerning in one patient and
              completely expected in another based on their history. AI sees the number;
              your doctor sees the context.

          <summary>Learn More: When AI interpretation might be misleading</summary>
          <div class="learn-more-content">
            <p>
              There are specific situations where AI interpretation of your health data
              could lead you astray:
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Reference ranges vary:</strong> What's "normal" can differ by age, sex,
              and other factors. AI might flag something as abnormal that's actually fine for you.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Context matters:</strong> A high heart rate during exercise is normal;
              the same heart rate at rest might be concerning. AI may not always have this context.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Correlations aren't causation:</strong> AI might notice two things happening
              together without understanding which caused which, or if they're even related.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Rare conditions:</strong> AI has less training data on uncommon conditions
              and may be less accurate when dealing with them.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Individual variation:</strong> Your normal might be different from
              population averages. A value that's fine for you might look concerning to AI.
