        <h2>AI Learns From Imperfect Data</h2>

        <p>
          As we discussed in the previous module, AI learns by training on vast amounts
          of text from the internet, books, and other sources. Here's the problem: that
          data reflects the biases, gaps, and inequities of the real world.
        </p>

        <p>
          If most medical research historically focused on certain populations, AI
          learned from that. If certain communities are underrepresented in health
          literature, AI knows less about them. These aren't AI's "choices" - they're
          patterns inherited from its training data.
        </p>

        <div class="callout-pearl">
          <div class="callout-title"><i data-lucide="lightbulb"></i> Pearl</div>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
            Bias in AI usually isn't intentional discrimination. It's patterns learned
            from data that already contained gaps and biases. Understanding this helps
            you use AI more critically.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h3>The Data Reflects Society</h3>
        <p>
          Medical research has historically had significant representation problems.
          Women were routinely excluded from clinical trials until the 1990s. Many
          diseases have been studied primarily in white populations. Certain conditions
          receive far more research funding than others. All of this shapes the data
          AI learns from.
        </p>

        <p>
          When AI provides health information, it draws on these same sources. The
          information isn't filtered for representation - it reflects whatever was
          most prevalent in the training data.

        <h2>Types of Bias That Affect Health AI</h2>

        <div class="bias-type">
          <h4>Training Data Gaps</h4>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
            If certain groups are underrepresented in medical research and literature,
            AI has less data to learn from about those groups. Historically, medical
            research has often focused on white, male populations. AI trained on this
            data may be less accurate for other groups.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="bias-type">
          <h4>Language and Cultural Assumptions</h4>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
            AI trained primarily on English text from Western sources may not understand
            how health is discussed in other languages or cultures. Symptoms might be
            described differently, or health concerns might be framed differently.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="bias-type">
          <h4>Historical Discrimination Patterns</h4>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
            If AI learns from text that reflects historical discrimination in healthcare,
            it might reproduce those patterns. For example, pain has historically been
            undertreated in certain populations - AI might reflect those biased patterns.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="bias-type">
          <h4>Socioeconomic Assumptions</h4>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
            AI might assume access to healthcare, medications, or lifestyle options that
            aren't available to everyone. Its recommendations might not account for
            real-world barriers to care.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="research-highlight">
          <h4>Research Finding: The Optum Algorithm Study</h4>
          <p>
            A landmark 2019 study published in Science examined an algorithm used by health
            systems to identify patients needing extra care. The study found the algorithm
            systematically underestimated the health needs of Black patients compared to
            white patients with similar health conditions.
          </p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
            The algorithm used healthcare costs as a proxy for health needs. Because Black
            patients historically had less access to healthcare, they had lower costs - even
            when they were equally sick. This created a bias that affected real care decisions.

            <strong>Research Finding:</strong> Studies have found that AI systems used
            in healthcare can perpetuate existing disparities. One widely reported study

          <summary>Learn More: The pulse oximeter bias problem</summary>
          <div class="learn-more-content">
            <p>
              A stark example of how medical devices can have built-in bias involves pulse
              oximeters - the devices that clip on your finger to measure blood oxygen levels.
              Research has shown these devices are less accurate for patients with darker skin.
            </p>
            <p>
              A 2020 study in the New England Journal of Medicine found that Black patients
              were nearly three times as likely as white patients to have low blood oxygen
              levels that went undetected by pulse oximetry. This has real clinical consequences -
              patients may not receive needed oxygen therapy.
            </p>
            <p>
              This bias exists because the devices were primarily calibrated using lighter-skinned
              individuals. Similar issues can affect AI trained on data that reflects these
              measurement biases.

        <h2>How Bias Shows Up in AI Dermatology</h2>

        <p>
          One of the most studied areas of AI healthcare bias involves dermatology - the
          medical specialty dealing with skin conditions. This is a clear example of how
          training data affects AI accuracy differently across populations.
        </p>

        <div class="research-highlight">
          <h4>Research Finding: Skin Condition Recognition</h4>
          <p>
            Studies examining AI systems designed to recognize skin conditions have found
            significant disparities in accuracy across skin tones. When AI image recognition
            systems are trained primarily on images of lighter skin, they perform worse at
            identifying conditions on darker skin.
          </p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
            This matters because many serious skin conditions - including skin cancer - can
            present differently in different skin tones, and early detection is often critical.

        <p>
          Text-based AI like ChatGPT can also reflect these biases. When describing how
          conditions appear, AI tends to describe "typical" presentations - which often
          means presentations in lighter skin, because that's what dominated training data.

        <h2>How Bias Might Show Up in Your AI Conversations</h2>

        <p>
          Here are some concrete ways bias might affect the answers you get:
        </p>

        <div class="example-scenario">
          <h4>Example: Symptom Descriptions</h4>
          <p>
            AI might describe how a condition appears "typically" based on how it was
            described in training data. But conditions can present differently in different
            skin tones, body types, or age groups. The "typical" description might not
            match your experience.
          </p>
          <p style="color: #16a34a;">
            <strong>What to do:</strong> Ask specifically how symptoms might appear for
            someone with your characteristics. "How might this appear in darker skin tones?"
            or "Does this present differently in women?"
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="example-scenario">
          <h4>Example: Treatment Recommendations</h4>
          <p>
            AI might suggest treatments that assume certain access or circumstances. It
            might recommend brand-name medications when generics exist, assume you have
            insurance, or suggest specialists without considering availability.
          </p>
          <p style="color: #16a34a;">
            <strong>What to do:</strong> Specify your situation. "What options exist if
            I don't have insurance?" or "What if I can't afford brand-name medications?"
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="example-scenario">
          <h4>Example: Risk Assessments</h4>
          <p>
            AI might overstate or understate risks based on who was studied in research.
            If a condition was primarily studied in one population, the risk factors and
            statistics might not apply accurately to others.
          </p>
          <p style="color: #16a34a;">
            <strong>What to do:</strong> Ask about limitations. "Is this risk information
            based on studies that included people like me?" or "How might these risks
            differ for my demographic?"
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="example-scenario">
          <h4>Example: Pain Assessment</h4>
          <p>
            Historical biases in pain treatment - where some groups' pain has been
            systematically undertreated - may be reflected in AI responses. AI might
            be more or less likely to validate pain concerns based on how similar
            concerns were discussed in training data.
          </p>
          <p style="color: #16a34a;">
            <strong>What to do:</strong> Be specific about your pain experience. If AI
            seems dismissive, recognize this may reflect biases in its training and
            advocate for yourself with your healthcare provider.

        <h2>Algorithmic Fairness: A Growing Field</h2>

        <p>
          The study of how to make AI systems more fair is an active area of research
          called "algorithmic fairness." Researchers are developing methods to detect
          and reduce bias in AI systems, though this work is far from complete.
        </p>

        <h3>Key Concepts in Algorithmic Fairness</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Demographic parity:</strong> An AI system produces similar outcomes across different groups</li>
          <li><strong>Equal opportunity:</strong> An AI system has similar accuracy rates across groups for correct predictions</li>
          <li><strong>Calibration:</strong> When AI expresses confidence, that confidence is equally accurate across groups</li>
          <li><strong>Individual fairness:</strong> Similar individuals receive similar treatment from AI</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The challenge is that these definitions of fairness can conflict with each other.
          Achieving perfect fairness by one definition may make it impossible to achieve
          by another. Researchers and developers must make difficult tradeoffs.
        </p>

        <p class="citation">
          Source: <a href="https://fairmlbook.org/" target="_blank">Barocas, Hardt & Narayanan, "Fairness and Machine Learning" (2023)</a>
        </p>

        <details class="learn-more">
          <summary>Learn More: Why fairness is mathematically complicated</summary>
          <div class="learn-more-content">
            <p>
              Researchers have proven that certain definitions of fairness cannot be
              achieved simultaneously - this is sometimes called the "impossibility theorem"
              of fairness.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example, if disease rates differ between groups, you cannot simultaneously
              have: (1) equal false positive rates across groups, (2) equal false negative
              rates across groups, and (3) equal positive predictive values across groups.
            </p>
            <p>
              This means that even well-intentioned AI developers must choose which type
              of fairness to prioritize - and different choices affect different groups
              in different ways.

          <h4>Why This Matters</h4>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
            AI tools are increasingly being used in healthcare - not just by patients,
            but by providers too. If these tools contain biases, they could affect
            diagnostic accuracy, treatment recommendations, and resource allocation.
            Being aware of this helps you be a better advocate for yourself.

        <h3>Groups That May Be Affected</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Racial and ethnic minorities:</strong> Underrepresented in much medical research</li>
          <li><strong>Women:</strong> Many conditions historically studied primarily in men</li>
          <li><strong>Older adults:</strong> Often excluded from clinical trials</li>
          <li><strong>LGBTQ+ individuals:</strong> Limited representation in medical literature</li>
          <li><strong>People with disabilities:</strong> Health needs may not be well-represented</li>
          <li><strong>Rural populations:</strong> Access-related assumptions may not fit</li>
          <li><strong>Non-English speakers:</strong> Less training data in other languages</li>
          <li><strong>Low-income individuals:</strong> Healthcare access assumptions may not apply</li>

          <h4>Research Finding: Cardiovascular Risk in Women</h4>
          <p>
            Heart disease in women has historically been understudied. Women often present
            with different symptoms than men - for example, women having heart attacks may
            experience fatigue, nausea, or jaw pain rather than the "classic" chest pain.
          </p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
            AI trained on medical literature that focused on male presentations might not
            adequately describe how heart disease presents in women, potentially leading
            to delayed recognition of serious symptoms.

            If you belong to a group that has historically faced discrimination in healthcare,
            be especially cautious with AI health information. The same biases that have
            affected your care might be reflected in AI's responses.

            <p>
              Medical research has a troubled history with representation:
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Women in clinical trials:</strong> Until 1993, women were routinely
              excluded from clinical trials in the U.S. due to concerns about pregnancy
              and hormonal variability. This means decades of drug and treatment research
              was conducted primarily on men.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Racial representation:</strong> Studies have consistently shown that
              minority populations are underrepresented in clinical trials. A 2021 FDA
              analysis found that white participants made up about 75% of clinical trial
              participants, despite being about 60% of the U.S. population.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Age exclusions:</strong> Many trials exclude older adults due to
              concerns about comorbidities and drug interactions - even though older adults
              are often the primary users of the medications being tested.
            </p>
            <p>
              All of this shapes the medical literature that AI learns from.

        <h2>What You Can Do</h2>

        <p>
          Knowing about AI bias doesn't mean you can't use AI - it means you can use
          it more thoughtfully. Here are strategies:
        </p>

        <h3>Be Specific About Who You Are</h3>
        <p>
          Don't let AI assume. Include relevant details about your age, sex, race, and
          other factors that might affect health information. Ask how recommendations
          might differ for someone like you.
        </p>

        <h3>Ask About Limitations</h3>
        <p>
          "Is this information based on research that included people like me?"
          "Are there known differences in how this condition affects different populations?"
          These questions prompt AI to surface limitations it might otherwise gloss over.
        </p>

        <h3>Seek Multiple Perspectives</h3>
        <p>
          Don't rely solely on AI. Cross-reference with sources specific to your community.
          Patient advocacy groups, community health organizations, and providers who
          serve diverse populations may have more relevant information.
        </p>

        <h3>Advocate With Your Healthcare Team</h3>
        <p>
          If you notice AI providing information that doesn't seem to fit your experience,
          discuss it with your doctor. They can help you understand whether there are
          real differences in how something applies to you.
        </p>

        <h3>Know Your Rights</h3>
        <p>
          As AI becomes more common in healthcare settings, patients are gaining rights
          related to AI-assisted decisions. Some jurisdictions are beginning to require
          transparency when AI is used in healthcare decisions. Ask your providers how
          AI is being used in your care.
        </p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
            Before accepting AI health information, ask: "Would this answer be different
            if I were a different age, sex, or race? What populations was the research
            behind this information based on?"

          <div class="learn-more-content">
            <p>
              AI companies are aware of bias issues and working on them, though progress
              varies. Approaches include:
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Diverse training data:</strong> Efforts to include more varied sources
              in training, though historical gaps in research can't be fully compensated for.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Bias testing:</strong> Evaluating AI systems for differential performance
              across groups before release.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Transparency:</strong> Some companies are becoming more open about
              limitations and potential biases.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Human oversight:</strong> Building systems that keep humans in the
              loop for high-stakes decisions.
            </p>
            <p>
              These efforts help, but bias in AI remains an ongoing challenge. Your awareness
              is an important additional safeguard.

          <div class="learn-more-content">
            <p>
              Governments and regulatory bodies are beginning to address AI bias in healthcare:
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>FDA guidance:</strong> The FDA has issued guidance on clinical decision
              support software and is developing frameworks for evaluating AI medical devices,
              including considerations for bias.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>CMS requirements:</strong> The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services
              has begun requiring health plans to evaluate algorithms for potential discrimination.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>State laws:</strong> Some states are passing laws requiring transparency
              and fairness testing for AI used in healthcare settings.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>International efforts:</strong> The EU AI Act and other international
              regulations are establishing requirements for high-risk AI applications,
              including those in healthcare.
            </p>
            <p>
              These regulations are still evolving, but they represent growing recognition
              that AI bias in healthcare needs systematic attention.

        <h2>Bias Works Both Ways</h2>

        <p>
          It's worth noting that bias can also mean AI overcorrects or makes assumptions
          in trying to avoid stereotypes. The goal isn't to find perfectly unbiased AI -
          that doesn't exist - but to use AI critically, knowing its limitations.
        </p>

        <p>
          Sometimes AI might refuse to discuss certain health topics or provide generic
          responses when specific information would be more helpful, in an attempt to
          avoid potential bias. This can also affect the usefulness of AI health information.
        </p>

        <div class="callout-pearl">
          <div class="callout-title"><i data-lucide="lightbulb"></i> Pearl</div>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
            The best approach is to think of AI as one input among many. Get information
            from AI, but also from your healthcare team, patient communities, and trusted
            health organizations. Multiple perspectives help overcome any single source's
            biases.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h3>The Path Forward</h3>
        <p>
          Addressing AI bias in healthcare requires effort from multiple directions:
          more diverse clinical research, better training data, algorithmic fairness
          techniques, regulatory oversight, and informed patients who advocate for
          themselves.
        </p>

        <p>
          You can't fix AI bias as an individual, but you can protect yourself by
          using AI critically and maintaining a healthy skepticism - especially for
          information that could affect important health decisions.
